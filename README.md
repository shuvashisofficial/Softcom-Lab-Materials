## Cyber Security Lab
In this lab, I learned about securing data using cryptographic techniques and algorithms. I implemented classic encryption methods like Caesar cipher, monoalphabetic ciphers, and column transposition. I also worked on digital signature algorithms to understand authentication and integrity in data communication.
